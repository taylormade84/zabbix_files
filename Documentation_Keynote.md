### Start with what the reader **needs**

### Write less 
* Don't try to cover all edge cases
* Sometimes information about how a subcomponent works isn't relavent 

### Write the outline first 
* Questions that come up from the end-users
* **needs** will outline the document titles

### Rubber ducking works for docs too 
* talking out loud about what you're trying to convey 

### Write readability techniques 
* bulletpoints
* lists
* formatted in code if it fits the contexts

### Use instructive wording - Direct language not passive
Example:
 
 **DO**  | **DONT** |
-------  | ----------------  |
If X happens do Y | If X happens try to do this and check Y |
